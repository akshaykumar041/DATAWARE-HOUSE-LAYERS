# DATAWARE-HOUSE-LAYERS
This project uses a Medallion Architecture with ETL pipelines across Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers. Bronze stores raw source data, Silver cleans and standardizes it, and Gold delivers curated business-ready insights. This layered design ensures scalability, quality, and auditability.
